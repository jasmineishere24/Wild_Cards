# Balatro-style Prototype

This is a **pure HTML5/JS prototype** of a Balatro-style poker-hand game:

- 5-card hands
- Hold and discard functionality
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) represented as shapes (trapezoid, parallelogram, star)
- Fully playable in browser on iPhone, iPad, or laptop
- No AI-generated images; all graphics drawn with canvas

## How to play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (or host on GitHub Pages).
2. Click **Deal** to draw 5 cards.
3. Tap a card to toggle hold/unhold.
4. Click **Discard Selected** to replace unheld cards.
5. Click **Play Hand** to score chips.
6. Try to beat the round target before running out of hands.

## Deployment

1. Push the folder to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → Main branch / root**.
3. Access via `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`
